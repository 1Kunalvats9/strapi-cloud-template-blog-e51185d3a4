# Fixing TypeScript Errors in Reviews Controller

## Issue
The TypeScript errors in `src/api/review/controllers/review.js` are occurring because Strapi's type system hasn't been regenerated to recognize the new schema fields we added to the review collection.

## Solution

### Option 1: Regenerate Strapi Types (Recommended)
Run the following commands to regenerate Strapi's TypeScript types:

```bash
# Stop Strapi if running
# Then run:
npm run build
# or
strapi build
```

This will regenerate the TypeScript types based on the updated schema.

### Option 2: Restart Strapi Development Server
Sometimes a simple restart is enough:

```bash
# Stop the current Strapi server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run develop
```

### Option 3: Clear Strapi Cache
If the above doesn't work, clear Strapi's cache:

```bash
# Stop Strapi
# Delete cache files
rm -rf .tmp
rm -rf build
rm -rf dist

# Restart Strapi
npm run develop
```

## Expected Behavior
After regenerating types, the TypeScript errors should disappear because:

1. The new schema fields (`source_platform`, `author_name`, `review_text`, etc.) will be recognized
2. The filter types will be updated to include the new fields
3. The sort options will include `review_timestamp`

## Current Status
The controller code is functionally correct and will work properly at runtime. The TypeScript errors are only affecting the development experience and don't impact the actual functionality.

## Verification
After fixing the types, you can verify the controller works by:

1. Starting Strapi: `npm run develop`
2. Testing the endpoint: `GET /api/reviews/latest`
3. Checking the Strapi admin panel for the new review fields

## Note
The controller includes proper error handling and fallback values, so it will work correctly even if some fields are missing during the transition period.
